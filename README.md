# Crop Fertilizer Prediction

This project predicts the best fertilizer for a given crop based on soil and environmental conditions such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, and Rainfall. It uses Machine Learning to assist farmers and agricultural researchers in optimizing crop yield.

## Features
- Input soil and weather conditions
- Predict the most suitable fertilizer
- Uses machine learning models for prediction
- Easy to extend with more data or algorithms

## Tech Stack
- Python (3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook / .py scripts
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
Run the notebook:
jupyter notebook "Crop Fertilizer Prediction.ipynb"

Or run the Python script:
python crop_fertilizer_prediction.py

## Example Input
Nitrogen (N): 90
Phosphorus (P): 42
Potassium (K): 43
Temperature: 26.5Â°C
Humidity: 80%
pH: 6.5
Rainfall: 200 mm

## Example Output
Recommended Fertilizer: Urea
